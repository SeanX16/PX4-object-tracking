# Vision-Based UAV Target Tracking (Final Year Project)

This repository contains the source code and documentation for my final year project. The project simulates an autonomous UAV that tracks a moving ground robot (TurtleBot3) using visual input from a downward-facing camera.

---

## Features

- Visual target detection using OpenCV
- Velocity-based control using MAVROS
- OFFBOARD mode flight with PX4 SITL
- Basic recovery behavior when the target is lost
- Full ROS-Gazebo simulation setup

## Demo Video

## Environment

- VMware Workstation 16 Player
- Ubuntu 18.04
- ROS Melodic
- PX4 v1.11.0-beta1
- Gazebo 9
- MAVROS
- OpenCV

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to my supervisor and the Department of ELEL at CityUHK.

This project builds upon open-source tools from the PX4, ROS, and OpenCV communities.
