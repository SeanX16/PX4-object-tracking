# Vision-Based UAV Target Tracking · Final Year Project

This repository contains the source code and documentation for my undergraduate final year project.

It simulates an autonomous UAV that tracks a moving ground robot (TurtleBot3) using visual input from a downward-facing camera, implemented entirely in a ROS–PX4–Gazebo environment.
